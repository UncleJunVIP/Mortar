## How do I setup Mortar?

1. Own a TrimUI Brick or Smart Pro and have a SD Card with NextUI.
2. Connect your device to a Wi-Fi network.
3. Download the latest Mortar release from this repo or install it using [Pak Store](https://github.com/UncleJunVIP/nextui-pak-store).
   - If downloading manually, unzip the release before continuing.
4. Edit one of the templates [found here](/.github/resources/config_examples).
   - Use your üß†. I believe in you!
5. Save the edited template as `config.yml`.
    - Pak Store Users: upload `config.yml` to `SD_ROOT/Tools/tg5040/Mortar.pak`.
    - Manual Installers: upload the `Mortar.pak` directory that came in the releases zip and place `config.yml` inside.
6. Launch `Mortar` from the `Tools` menu and enjoy!
